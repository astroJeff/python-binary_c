First, we need to compile binary_c_api.c into a shared library

gcc binary_c_api.c -c -lbinary_c -lm -lc -fpic
gcc -shared -o libbinary_c_api.so binary_c_api.o


Next, we need to make sure that the current directory (that containing libbinary_c_api.so) is included in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=....


Next, we compile the python setup.py script:
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Within python, you should be able to now run:
python python_API_test.py


Or access the python functions within an ipython notebook:
import binary_c
binary_c.function_name()
